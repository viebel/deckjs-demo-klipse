== TALK TITLE
Principles of data oriented programming
What makes Clojure system less complex

== TAKE AWAYS

. The reason why Clojure systems tend to be less complex
. How to explain to non-Clojure friends what's great about Clojure
. How to apply DO principles to other programming languages
. What is the price of applying DO principles
. The audience is interested in buying my book

== SCENARIOS

Try to avoid code snippets.
Put mostly diagrams in the slides and try to avoid too much text in the slides.

Do not spend too much time on immutability.

=== Scenarios
. The essence of Clojure (the features of Clojure)
.. Homoiconic
... Extensibility of the language
... Structural editing (Paredit, Parinfer)
.. Functional
... Power of expression
.. REPL
... Short feedback loop
... Code exploration
.. Data oriented
... Reduce complexity of the system
. Simplifying a class diagram by separating code from data
. Weak dependency between code and data
. Universal access to data
. The price of DO
.. The genius of Clojure records
.. Applying DO principles to other languages
.. Data manipulation libs
... Lodash in all languages
.. Dynamic
... Immutable data structures are not native
.. Static
... Immutable data structures are not native
... Requires static casting
. Data as a first class citizen
=== Obstacles
. DO is the same as FP
. DO is only applicable in dynamically typed languages
